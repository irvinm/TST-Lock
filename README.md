# TST-Lock

This is the project that is based on removing the ability to accidentally close a tab via the "X" for tabs that you consider important and don't want to lose. Holding "Ctrl + Shift" while clicking on a tab will replace the "X" with a lock graphic. You can still close the tab (even with the lock displayed) by right-clicking and selecting "Close Tab".
